## üöÄ Getting Started

### üì¶ 1. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed. Then run:

`npm install`

### ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Create Your Own Environment File

Create your own .env file in the root directory.

Your .env file should look like this:

```bash
DATABASE_URL = your_database_url_here
JWT_SECRET = your_jwt_secret_here
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME = your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY = your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET = your_cloudinary_api_secret
```

üõë Never commit your .env file to version control.

### üß™ 3. Run the Development Server

`npm run dev`

### üß© 4. Prisma & Seeding Database

#### 1. Update your schema and generate client

```bash
npx prisma db push
npx prisma generate
```

#### 2. Seed initial pet data

```bash
npx prisma db seed
```

#### 3. Swap seeding files for product data

Rename `seed.ts` ‚Üí `seed-pet.ts`, and `seed2.ts` ‚Üí `seed.ts`, then run:

```bash
npx prisma db seed
```

#### 4. Seed alternative dataset (e.g., donation products)

You can also run alternative seed logic:

```bash
npm run seed-alt
```

(Defined in `package.json` as a shortcut for executing `prisma/dont-seed-this.ts`.)

#### 5. Inspect your data

Use Prisma Studio to browse and verify seeded data:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

Or view directly in your NeonDB dashboard.

Open your browser and visit for local development : [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
